# SU(2)

This article is based on the book Topology Geometry and Garuge Fields, 1997


Whilest I was studying how to utilize the unit normal vector in gtsam, I had to study more about its basics.

SU(2) the Special unitary group

SO(3) the Special orthogonal group : the group of 3 by 3 matrices $$A$$ that satisfies: 
1. $$A^{-1} = A^{\top}$$ and 
2. $$det A = 1$$.

In physical meaning, it is a linear transformations that rotate $$\mathcal{R}^3$$

With a normal vector $$\vec{n} = <n_1, n_2, n_3>$$, and a scalar $$\phi$$, Define a $$3 \times 3$$ matrix $$R(\phi, \vec{n})$$ by

$$
R(\phi, \vec{n}) = I_{3\times 3} + (sin\phi)N + (1-cos\phi)N^2
$$

where

$$
N = \begin{bmatrix}
0 & -n_3 & n_2 \\
n^3 & 0 & -n_1 \\
-n_2 & n_1 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
$$

This matrix rotates the standard basis for $$\mathcal{R}^3$$ through angle $$\phi$$ about the axis along $$\vec{n}$$ in the sense determined by the right-hand rule.
